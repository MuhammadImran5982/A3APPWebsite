<h2>Group Processes and Communication</h2>
									<p>The group got off to a rocky start, having only Louisa doing the work and again a lack of communication towards the project until the other members realised that the deadline was coming to a close. Throughout the rest of the project group RDC has done a great job with communication remotely. There were two meetings a week and the majority of us showed up to contribute towards the meeting. Nonverbally wise the group was exceptional when it came to how to contact another for help and information requiring what needed to be done and projected information. Discord was our main direct contact manager whilst teams was our formal group discussion page where video meetings were also held. Someone members did struggle to help out and fill in gaps where it was needed but overall the group worked quite seamlessly together.</p>
									
									<h2>Individual Reflections </h2>
									<h3>Muhammad</h3>
									<p>Assignment 3 was a breeze with such amazing team members. Compared to assignment 2 we had much more communication, and everyone was updated as to what needs to be done. James went above and beyond with the application, and it looks amazing, and he has tried getting most of the features to work. Lachlan has always been there for help anytime when needed, he drew the layout diagrams to a high level of details which made it easier to be put in Figma for a final stage of layout diagram process. Louisa has always volunteered and steered the group where it needs to go. Help with most of the report work as well as amazing figma layout diagrams. Louisa managed the group very well and if it wasn’t for her, we would not be this organised for assignment 3. I have been able to focus on my part of the work knowing that the group will contribute their part and we will not have any issues. Overall, this assignment was great, we had amazing teamwork, communication, and the utmost support from every team member if anyone required it. This assignment went exactly how I thought it would go with no issues. </p>
									<h3>Lachlan</h3>
									<p>For assignment three, we all worked quite well in getting the assignment done. Although we were somewhat slow to begin working on the project, due to everyone wanting to have a break after the end of assignment two, we all came together to work quite hard on completing the assignment. When we first came together, I had started on some paper wireframe designs, which I then gave to Louisa after I had completed them so she could create high quality versions through Figma. Her work in making these high-quality designs was remarkable, with her colour choices truly enhancing the feel of the map in combination with the design for the app logo. James and Muhammad have continued to show amazing prowess in website creation and app creation with the two being the primary team members responsible for those parts of the assignment. The website was put together nicely by Muhammad as well as James putting in some gruelling hours to get a somewhat functional app finished and was able to make something we all could be proud of.</p>
									<h3>Louisa</h3>
									<p>Overall, I believe the group worked a lot better than last time. Our communication was stronger, having people voice their issues and needs as they were occuring, instead of leaving it to the day before the deadline. Lachlan surprised me with his vision for paper mockups, his creativity really aided me in creating what became the high fidelity mockups. James’ coding skills were massively undermined. He had not mentioned previously that he had experience in coding and his ability to quickly yet brilliantly curate the wireframe that I had created was incredible. Much like last time, Muhammad’s website building skills amazed the group, not only that but his work ethic is like nothing I have seen before. He works fast and efficiently, he gets his work done and he does not waste time. This is a quality in which I aspire to have, and it has really made him a valuable team player. Upon reflection, I believe as a whole, we could have improved our overall work ethic, although we had players like Moey that contributed everything required of him as well as James and Lachlan who also did the work, it took us a while to actually start the process of the assignment and we all struggled with the workload, however we managed to get there in the end. I definitely believe we did the best that we could, given that we were disadvantaged by the team member that left after our last assignment. Reflecting on myself, I can truthfully say that I gave my all when I could and given the circumstances that I was under, having copious amounts of work training. I stayed on task, submitted work within the group deadlines and led the team as best as I possibly could.</p>
									<h3>James</h3>
									<p>The group went well throughout the project timeline. It’s been much better since the first assignment with workflow and productivity. We delegated well on what needed to be done and as such were much more organised. However some downfalls came to the deadline, the application which i’ve been working on has been troubling to say the least to get working on and feel it would have been better if we understood where we wanted to go through with the project. However, non the less the group has done amazing work, and feel this is a definite improvement, with work related issues as i know from Muhhamad, lauchie, louis and myself it’s not been easy. Writing this now I'm on 2 hours of sleep however I've been motivated by my team and extremely happy with their application towards the project.</p>
